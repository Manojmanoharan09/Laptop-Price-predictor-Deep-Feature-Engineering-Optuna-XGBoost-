# Laptop Price Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project revolves around a comprehensive analysis of a dataset consisting of various specifications and prices of laptops. The primary aim is to glean insights into the factors that significantly affect laptop prices and to build predictive models that can accurately estimate laptop prices based on their specifications. This analysis not only aids in understanding market trends but also assists in making informed decisions for potential buyers and sellers in the tech industry.

## Key Features of the Project

### Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
The raw dataset was meticulously cleaned to ensure accuracy in the modeling process. Feature engineering was employed to transform non-numerical columns into formats suitable for analysis and predictive modeling, focusing on critical attributes like CPU, RAM, and Memory.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Thorough EDA was conducted to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the data, which provided pivotal insights into the factors that influence laptop prices.

### Data Preparation for Machine Learning
The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and scaling features to prepare for machine learning.

### Predictive Modeling
Two advanced machine learning models, Random Forest and XGBoost, were developed and optimized using OPTUNA to predict laptop prices. The models were evaluated based on their performance metrics, and their predictions were visualized for comparative analysis.

### Result Summary
The outcomes of the predictive models were summarized and presented through visualizations to depict the accuracy and effectiveness of each model in predicting laptop prices.

## Tools Used
- **Python:** Main programming language used for all phases of the project.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Plotly:** For creating interactive and static visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For implementing and evaluating machine learning models.
